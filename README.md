# XCERRCAL

X-modular C Error library for Cascade Aggregation and Logging

## What is it ?

A modular C library that captures errors flowing through layered calls, unifies them into a central collection, and records detailed logs for easy debugging across differents units and libraries of the code

## Note

This is a library I made for unifying my errors throughout my libraries for my 42 projects. In the same mean it had to comply to the 42 norms and I don't recommand using this for anyhing else than a C 42 project.
